### Texts

- [An Introduction to Applied Multivariate Analysis](http://fcc-statistics.wikispaces.com/file/view/An+Introduction+to+Applied+Multivariate+Analysis+By+Tenko+Raykov,+George+A.+Marcoulides.pdf) (Raykov, T. & Marcoulides, G.A , 2008. New York, NY: Routledge)

- [A First Course in Structural Equation Modeling](http://www.rmcs.buu.ac.th/drpoonpong/file/A_First_Course_in_Structural_Equation_Modeling__2nd_edition.pdf) (Raykov, T. & Marcoulides, G.A ,2006. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.)


### Course Description

This course will introduce you to a variety of multivariate techniques, primarily those with the goal of data reduction (principal components and factor analysis) and complex hypothesis testing (structural equation modeling). 

### Course Objectives

Learning statistical methods is like learning a language. One course will improve your ability to read and understand other peopleâ€™s work. Becoming comfortable with the methods will require your use of them with data meaningful to you. In this course we will work on understanding when, why and how to implement a particular analysis, as well as how to interpret the product of the analysis.  Assignments are intended to help you become more comfortable with using syntax in statistical analysis software.
